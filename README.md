# tictail_todo
An mvc todo coding experiment

? How the hell is flask unit testing supposed to handle 500?

Dependencies

Flask
Coffee script compilation
Mongo
mongokit
shortuuid
enum

Notes
Didn't bother w/ csrf
ditto database reconnection (could be builtin)
MongoKit doesn't load as objects. Annoying
